# vrp_optimization
It was a team project during the course "Optimization Methods in Management Science".
We decelopped an optimized solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem having 200 geographical spots to be served by trucks.
We used the Clarke & Wright heuristic strategy and Tabu Search to extract better results.
The result was that 25 trucks could serve the 200 spots in the time of 4.11 hours.
